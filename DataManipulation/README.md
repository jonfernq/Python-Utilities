## Data Manipulation

Also known as 'data wrangling' or 'data munging': "the process of cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis."

"Data munging involves a variety of tasks such as handling missing data, 
converting data types, merging and joining datasets, filtering and sorting data, 
and creating new variables or features. It is an important step in the data analysis pipeline 
because raw data often contains errors, inconsistencies, and other issues that must be addressed 
before meaningful insights can be extracted."
